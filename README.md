## **Getting Started**  

### **Prerequisites**  

- Flutter SDK installed ([installation guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)).  
- An OpenWeatherMap API key ([get yours here](https://openweathermap.org/appid)).

### **Setup Instructions**  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/minimal-weather-app.git  
   cd minimal-weather-app  
   ```  

2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   flutter pub get  
   ```  

3. Add your OpenWeatherMap API key:  
   Replace the placeholder API key in `WeatherService` class with your actual API key.  

4. Run the application:  
   ```bash  
   flutter run  
   ```

## **How It Works**  

1. The app requests location permissions to fetch the user's current city using geolocation services.  
2. The weather data is retrieved via the OpenWeatherMap API.  
3. Users can input the name of a city in the search bar to view its weather details.  
4. Animated weather conditions are displayed using Lottie files, enhancing the user experience.
